Write a C++ program that has a Polygon interface that has abstract functions, 
area(), and perimeter(). Implement classes for Triangle, Quadrilateral, Pentagon, 
Hexagon, and Octagon, which implement this interface, with the obvious meanings 
for the area() and perimeter() functions. Also implement classes, IsoscelesTriangle,
 EquilateralTriangle, Rectangle, and Square, which have the appropriate inheritance 
 relationships. Finally, write a simple user interface that allows users to create 
 polygons of the various types, input their geometric dimensions, and then output
  their area and perimeter. For extra effort, allow users to input polygons by 
specifying their vertex coordinates and be able to test if two such polygons are similar.
